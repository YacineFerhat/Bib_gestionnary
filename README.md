Hello!
here you will find one of my college projects, where I had to automize the system of a Library.
The project has been developped using JSP and Servlet, styled using the CSS Framwork Bulma and added a small JS part to Toggle some stuff, I used MYSQL as a database.

What can you get from it? 
  Authententification page, where the user has to enter his logs in order to access to the website, if he doesn't have an account, he can create one and get the access as a Simple user, the other role, is the Admin role, the actor that can manage the Library.
  
  For the Simple User:
    He can simply access to our website, check the books that we can provide him, and do some fetching according to his needs(Book title's, book writer's...)
    
  For the Admin:
    He can manage the whole system, by that I mean that
      -He can manage all of the users, books and writers
      -basically he can delete, add or modify the data stored in the database.

If you want to test it, you can simply Pull the project and use one of this 2 id's that I did provide to Log into the accounts and check the website.

For an admin access
Just type
for email Admin@gmail.com
for pwd admin

for an user acess
Just type
for email user@gmail.com
for pwd user

regards. Y.F
